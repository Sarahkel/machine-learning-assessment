# Assessment 2019: Machine Learning and Statistics 
Due: November 29th, 2019

## Objective
This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing) and the Python packages scipy, keras, and jupyter.

The assessment has 3 main objectives: describe, infer, predit.

1. Describe: Describe the Boston House Prices dataset using descriptive statistics and plots.
2. Infer: Use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t.
3. Predict: Use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.

All of this will be delivered within the Jupyter Notebook.
